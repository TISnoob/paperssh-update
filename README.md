# Discord SSH Bot
This is a simple bot for using shell commands within Discord.

> This bot does not use an actual SSH connection; it's named as such because it provides similar functionality to SSH, in that you can romotely execute commands on your computer from different devices and locations.

## Setup
_Only required for first run_
1.  Install NodeJS if it isn't already
2.  Create a Discord bot account (if you don't know how, [this guide][bot-creation-howto] explains the process quite well)
3.  Fill in `config.json` with the correct information
4.  Open a terminal in this project's root directory
5.  Run `npm i` to install dependencies

## Usage
1.  Open a terminal in this project's root directory
2.  Run `node index.js`
3.  Use any shell command in the channel specified in `config.json`
